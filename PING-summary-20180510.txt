SUMMARY OF PING CALL - 10 MAY 2018

Next call - Thursday 8 June 2018 at UTC 16

(1) HTML 5.3

A reminder that the Web Platform Working Group has requested privacy review comments by 25 May 2018 (see https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/2018AprJun/0026.html).

Please see Github for flagged privacy issues: https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?utf8=

Includes a privacy concern with ping attribute.

(2) Devices and Sensors Working Group Charter

The proposed charter for the Devices and Sensors Working Group is open for review. Comments are requested by 25 May 2018. This would be a good time to comment on the scoping of the work.

Note: sensors have been a challenge for Web privacy

It would be useful to have privacy people monitoring the WGâ€™s work as it progresses.

(3) Pointer Events Level 2 

There was a call for wide review. The features in this spec (Level 2) extend or modify those found in Pointer Events.

Pointer Events describes events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices including a mouse, pen, touchscreen, etc. 

Link to spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2/

Jason Novak will follow up to check that mitigations for privacy issues have been included in the security and privacy considerations. 

(4) Update on discussion about Client Hints

See: 

https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/2018AprJun/0004.html

and discussion at:

https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/206#issuecomment-379422513

It would be useful to look at implementation of client hints in Network Information API (https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/) and Device Memory 1 (https://w3c.github.io/device-memory/)

(5) More help for privacy reviews

PING needs more people to help with privacy reviews. Chairs will be reaching out to invite new people. Ideas for potential volunteers would be most welcome.

(6) Web privacy webinars

We are considering interspersing regular privacy webinars in our PING calls, with invited speakers (e.g. researchers).

Please share suggestions on the public-privacy email list.
